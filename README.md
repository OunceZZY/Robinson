# Robinson

Achieved:
1. So far it is able to detect the contradictory condition

To be fixed:
1. The Bound should not descent infinitely: I need to find a way of identify some positive or negative weighted bounds
    
   for example, the Within (self.U) table on (i,i) entry implies negatively weighted bounds, (i.e. $b$ negative bound,
    when doing some upperbounds $c$, $c - d*b$ for some constant $d$ is not a better upperbound)
